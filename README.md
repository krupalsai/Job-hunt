# Job Tracker

Government job notification tracker. Static page on Vercel, data in Supabase
(`xbjgmudcgjiompbroayr`), refreshed by a cron that reads official sources.

## Why the deadline handling looks the way it does

Six of the seven seeded rows had no real deadline — the UI showed guesses like
"~19 Aug expected" and "Exam tentatively 15 Oct 2026" under a bold **Deadline:**
label, and the header claimed "Updated <now>" on every page load while the data
was two days old.

So: `deadline` is a real timestamp or nothing. `is_estimated` marks the rest,
and the UI renders those as **Expected** with a badge. The header reports the
true age of the newest row and turns amber past 48 hours. Nothing in the
ingestion path is allowed to invent a date.

## Sources

| Source | Method | Status |
|---|---|---|
| TSLPRB | server-rendered vacancy table | ✅ working (18 posts, 7,437 vacancies) |
| Telegram channel | `t.me/s/<channel>` | ✅ only if the owner enables public preview |
| SCCL | server-rendered | ⚠️ no structured job table on the landing page |
| SSC | JavaScript SPA | ❌ needs a headless browser |
| HAL | JavaScript SPA | ❌ needs a headless browser |
| Instagram | login/challenge wall | ❌ no automated path |

A generic "recruitment-looking links" scraper was written first and removed —
on these sites it produced `Notification` and `Price Notification` (a coal price
notice). Only parsers verified against real markup ship.

SSC and HAL need a real browser; that belongs in a GitHub Actions job, where
Playwright is free and unmetered, rather than a Vercel function.

## Environment variables

    SUPABASE_URL                 https://xbjgmudcgjiompbroayr.supabase.co
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY    Supabase → Settings → API (server-side only)
    CRON_SECRET                  any long random string

## Running ingestion

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
      "https://krupal-job-tracker.vercel.app/api/ingest?dry_run=1"

`dry_run=1` reports what would change without writing. The cron runs daily at
01:30 UTC (07:00 IST) — see `vercel.json`.

Hand-curated rows (`ssc-`, `sccl-`, `tslprb-`, `iaf-`, `rrb-`, `hal-` prefixes)
are never overwritten by ingestion.
